<h1> 🎉 email-service. 📜 </h1>

This BackEnd project is an API Restfull using Java, Spring Boot following the concepts of clean architecture .

The API was developed for studying  and improvement of my technical backend skills also to demonstrate beginners and students how to implementing an Emails Shooting service as a core functionality of the application and others secondaries functions assigning other technologies.

To solve the core functionality I’m going to follow the [Uber-Code-Challenger | email service] (https://github.com/uber-archive/coding-challenge-tools/blob/master/coding_challenge.md)  repository as a guide and meeting your functional requirements and business rules
